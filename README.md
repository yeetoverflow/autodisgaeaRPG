# autodisgaeaRPG
AutoHotkey project that automates the grindy parts of DisgaeaRPG. The program does not modify DisgaeaRPG app. It simply scans BlueStacks instance for patterns and clicks or swipes accordingly.

## Setup [(video)](https://youtu.be/P-tkhNZyf8o)

* Download and Install [BlueStacks 5.0](https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html). (Recommended) Download 64-bit version since it seems to work better and crashes less. (Obsolete) Make sure that this installs in C:\Program Files\BlueStacks_nxt else sending swipe gesture will not work.
* Install DisgaeaRPG in BlueStacks instance and make sure you are up to date.
* Open BlueStacks 5 Multi-Instance Manager. Name master instance into DisgaeaRPG or create an instance and name it DisgaeaRPG because program targets by window name (this is optional because we can change the window target in the settings in autoDisgaeaRPG program).
* Go to Settings in BlueStacks instance
  * Performance
    * (Recommended) CPU allocation => (4 Cores)
    * (Recommended) Memory allocation => (4 GB)
    * (Recommended) Frame rate: 60
  * Display
    * (Required) Display resolution => (Portrait) 1080x1920
    * (Requred) Pixel density ==> 240 DPI (Medium)
  * Advanced
    * (Required) Android debug bridge => Enabled (this is required to be able be able to send swipe gestures)
* Set desktop resolution settings
    * Right click desktop
    * Select display settings
    * In scale and layout, set the value to 100%
* Download [autoDisgaeaRPG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yeetoverflow/autodisgaeaRPG/main/exe/autoDisgaeaRpg.exe) ([experimental version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yeetoverflow/autodisgaeaRPG/main/experimental/autoDisgaeaRpg.exe)) executable. (Recommended) Place this in a folder.
* Verify test
    * Open BlueStacks DisgaeaRPG instance and autoDisgaeaRPG.exe. Go to Settings tab in autoDisgaeaRPG program
    * If (Window) DETACHED => BAD
       * Either the program was opened after BlueStacks instance or the program does not know the window name of target BlueStacks instance (default target is DisgaeaRPG). Make Target Window text the same as the BlueStacks window name. Click Apply. You should be good when you see a green ATTACHED text.
    * If (Window Size) ??x?? => BAD (Target 600x1400)
       * Click resize 
       * If clicking resize does not work, your resolution is not the target resolution. Follow the instruction above (Set desktop resolution settings). Additionally, you can attempt to set a higher resolution for your desktop if available.
    * If verify says good on both metrics, you passed
* Patterns test
    * Go to stronghold in BlueStacks instance 
    * Go to Patterns tab in autoDisgaeaRPG
    * In the filter search tabs
    * Select dimensionGate
    * Select test
       * If you see Found as a tooltip and see a box on the dimension gate button you pass
       * If not, go cry then complain in the [autoDisgaeaRPG reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisgaeaRPGMobile/comments/qo36ua/autodisgaearpg)
* Swipe test (Obsolete - skip this if you're a newcomer)
    * Go to a screen in BlueStacks that needs swiping up or down. (Ex. companion select)
    * Make sure you see green ATTACHED in Main or Setting tab in autoDisgaeaRPG
    * Go to Handlers tab
    * Select SwipeUp or SwipeDown
    * If you see swiping happen you pass
    * If not
        * Go to Settings in BlueStacks instance
        * Go to Advanced
        * Note down the Android debug bridge port number. Ex. 127.0.0.1:5575 => 5575 is the port number
        * Go to Settings tab in autoDisgaeaRPG and place to port you found in the Override ADB port textbox then press apply
    * If nothing worked, wallow in despair then complain in the [autoDisgaeaRPG reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisgaeaRPGMobile/comments/qo36ua/autodisgaearpg)
